Version dependency
------------------

Currently this project is dependent on [videolab-1.1.3] that is compatible with
OP-Z v1.2 iOS app.

This repository doesn't include the videolab package. You have to manually
install `videolab-1.1.3.unitypackage` to open the examples on Unity Editor.

Note that you should use Unity 2018.4 (2018.4.29 recommended) when building videopaks; It's the only
version compatible with OP-Z v1.2.
